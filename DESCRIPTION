Description: A Bayesian nonparametric method for resolving multi-strain infections 
    using slice sampling with stick-breaking construction. The algorithm simultaneously 
    estimates strain haplotypes and links them to hosts from sequencing data. Supports 
    multiple observation models including categorical, Poisson, binomial, and negative 
    binomial distributions.
