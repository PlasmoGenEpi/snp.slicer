Description: Implementation of SNP-Slice, a Bayesian nonparametric method for resolving multi-strain infections using slice sampling with stick-breaking construction. The algorithm simultaneously estimates strain haplotypes and links them to hosts from sequencing data. Supports multiple observation models including categorical, Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial distributions.
